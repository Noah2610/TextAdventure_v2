# TextAdventure
This is the second attempt at a _terminal/text-based adventure game_.  
The project uses the Ruby Curses library.  
Proper documentation coming when there is something to show.
  
## Installation
Download repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Noah2610/TextAdventure_v2.git
```
### Package Dependencies
You need to have _Ruby_ and _ruby-bundler_ installed.
### Gem Dependencies
Execute the following in the root directory of the project:
```
$ bundle install
```
This will install the required gems and also download my [Ruby Command-Line Argument Parser Gem](https://github.com/Noah2610/ArgumentParser)  
into `./lib/argument_parser.rb`.
  
## Start Game
Start the game by executing:
```
$ ./TA.rb
```
Although there is nothing to see yet.

## Game Information
### Settings
There is a configuration file at `./src/settings.yml` which contains some general settings for the game.  
It mainly defines some minor tweaks used throughout the game. It has a bunch of comments decribing  
each value so you can check it out there if you are curious.
### Window Layout
There are 5 main Curses Windows used:
#### INPUT
This is the window the user types their commands in.  
It starts with a _prompt_ which will be different according to the current game mode (see below):
```
Normal Mode       = "> "
Conversation Mode = ">> "
```
These prompts can be set in `settings.yml`.
#### USER OUTPUT
This window echos any text the user submits through the _Input_ window.  
Just to give the User some feedback that their command has been recognized, even if nothing happens (no _Verbs_).
#### PRIMARY OUTPUT
All text output generated in _normal mode_ will be printed here.
#### CONVERSATION OUTPUT
All text output generated by a _Person_ in _conversation mode_ will be printed here.
#### STATUS
The Status window contains information such as the current _Room_ and all _Items_ in the _Player_'s _Inventory_.

## Development Information
I want to list some information that is relevant to the framework here.
### Nomenclature
Here I list the nomenclature of classes and the like in the game:
#### INPUT LINE
```ruby
module Input
  class Line
  end
end
```
When the user submits input, an _Input Line_ is created from the string.  
This _Line_ processes the user's input and splits the words into `Input::Words`.  
#### INPUT WORD
```ruby
module Input::Words
  class Word
  end
  class Item < Word
  end
  class Person < Word
  end
  class Room < Word
  end
end
```
Before an _Input Word_ is created, it is decided what type of _Word_ it will be (types being _Instance_ types)  
according to the the actual word string the user has typed.  
When no matching _Instance_ could be matched to the string, a regular `Input::Words::Word` is created  
which only stores the string and doesn't do anything special.
#### VERBS
```ruby
module Verbs
  class Verb
  end
  class Look < Verb
  end
end
```
_Verbs_ are the main keywords with which you will interact with the game.  
Without a _Verb_ in an _Input Line_, the input will have no meaning and nothing to do.  
The _Verb_ handles the user's input, after the words have been matched to _Instances_.  
The method `action` is called from the used _Verb_, which is passed all mentioned _Instances_. For example:  
```
> look at cornfield
```
`look` is the _Verb_ and `cornfield` is a _Room_.  
In this example the user wants to get the description of the _Room_ `cornfield`.

#### INSTANCE
```ruby
module Instances
  class Instance
  end
end
```
_Instances_ are:  
##### ITEMS
```ruby
module Instances::Items
  class Item < Instances::Instance
  end
  class Apple < Item
  end
end
```
An _Item_ is, as the name, takeable and useable objects.  
They can be placed in _Rooms_ or _Inventories_ which can be attached to any _Instance_.  
The _Player_ also has an _Inventory_ of course, although they are not an _Instance_.  
##### PERSONS
```ruby
module Instances::Persons
  class Person < Instances::Instance
  end
  class Alex < Person
  end
end
```
A _Person_ can be placed inside a _Room_; they can be talked to.  
They can also have an _Inventory_ so they are able to carry _Items_.  
##### ROOMS
```ruby
module Instances::Rooms
  class Room < Instances::Instance
  end
  class Cornfield < Room
  end
end
```
The _Player_ is always in a _Room_. _Persons_ are also placed in a _Room_.  
_Rooms_ can also have an _Inventory_ and store _Items_.  
  
All _Instances_ have configuration files located in `./src/Data` under their respective directories.  
These config files contain text such as Instance name(s) and description(s)  
and other text that might be used in their associated classes in the code.  
`keywords` are also defined in the configs, which are the words that can be used to access that _Instance_  
from within the game.  These `keywords` can be set as single words or regular expressions.
#### TERM
```ruby
module Terms
  class Term
  end
  class Take < Term
  end
end
```
_Terms_ are used in conversations. They are keywords that can trigger specific code.  
They also have configuration files in `./src/Data/Terms`.  
Usually they work together with _Instances_. For example:
```
>> take this apple
```
Where `take` it the _Term_ and `apple` is an _Item_ that will be passed to `take`'s `action` method.  
In this example the user tries to give the apple to the person they are in a conversation with.
