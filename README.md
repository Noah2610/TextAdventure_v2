# TextAdventure
This is the second attempt at a _terminal/text-based adventure game_.  
The project uses the Ruby Curses library.  
Proper documentation coming when there is something to show.
  
## Installation
Download repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Noah2610/TextAdventure_v2.git
```
### Package Dependencies
You need to have _Ruby_ and _ruby-bundler_ installed.
### Gem Dependencies
Execute the following in the root directory of the project:
```
$ bundle install
```
This will install the required gems and also download my [Ruby Command-Line Argument Parser Gem](https://github.com/Noah2610/ArgumentParser)  
into `./lib/argument_parser.rb`.
  
## Start Game
Start the game by executing:
```
$ ./TA.rb

Although there is nothing to see yet.
