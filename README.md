# TextAdventure
This is the second attempt at a _terminal/text-based adventure game_.  
Proper documentation coming when there is something to show.
  
## Installation
### Package Dependencies
You need to have _Ruby_ and _ruby-bundler_ installed.
### Gem Dependencies
Execute the following in the root directory of project:  
```
$ bundle install
```
It will install the required gems and also download my [Ruby ArgumentParser Gem](https://github.com/Noah2610/ArgumentParser)  
into `./lib/argument_parser.rb`.
  
## Start Game
Start the game by executing:  
```
$ ./TA.rb
```
Although there is nothing to see yet.
