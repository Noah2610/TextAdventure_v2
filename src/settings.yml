### Settings for differnet environments, these take priority
ENVIRONMENTS:
  production:
    logfile: 'production.log'

  development:
    logfile: 'development.log'
    input:
      ESCDELAY:            100
      history_size:        100
      prompt:              '$ '
      prompt_conversation: '> '
      border_color:        'blue'
      border_attr:         'bold'

  history_size:        100       # Amount of input lines to save
  prompt:              '> '      # Text to place before input field
  prompt_conversation: '>> '     # Same as prompt, but in conversation mode
  border_color:        'yellow'  # Border color of Input and Command History Window,
                                 # can be Array with foreground and background colors
                                 # or string for foreground and default background color
